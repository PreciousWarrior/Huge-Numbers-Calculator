# Huge-Numbers-Calculator
A large number calculator with currently only the exponentiation function. Can process huge calculations like 89218738^938742389^93274283479 and much higher numbers.

# How to install
Make sure you have python 3.x interpreter installed on your system, download the python file from GitHub, then run it by `python3 largeexpos.py`.

# How to Use
Using this program is exceptionally simple, just enter the expression (can ONLY contain positive real numbers, and the power symbol), then the answer will be calculated in a matter of milliseconds.

# TODO / Contributions
I need to add these things to the program, any contributions would be appreciated.
Short term-: Add support for negative numbers, and fix some errors with unexpected input.

If you have a beg, please report it with a screenshot of the error/bug as well as the expected output.
if you would like to help further, give input on how to fix the bug and/or make a PR.

Long term-: Add support for other huge number operations like factorial, and regular operations like multiplication and division.

# How it works and proof
To lazy to write this right now, basically works by using laws of logarithms and exponents and raising it to powers and blah blah blah and a custom function named Bhalogs which is basically just logs on crack.
